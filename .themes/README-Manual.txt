Vivacious Colors GTK Theme
by RAVEfinity Design.

http://www.ravefinity.com/p/vivacious-colors-gtk-theme.html

Vivacious Colors GTK is a NEW GTK 3/2 Theme by the RAVEfinity Open Design Team. It features a clean, vibrant and customizable look in 4 Styles. Light, Dark, Blackout, Fusion (Hybrid). Every style comes in 13 vivid colors. In your choice of "Pro" and "Regular."
Allowing you to make your desktop truly your own! ... Or you can just "be boring" and choose "Spring Blue".

GnomeShell users will find Vivacious Fully CSD compliant and ready for GnomeShell! And there is a few Cinnamon Shell Themes at long last too! And full support for Unity, Xfce, Mate, LXDE. OpenBox etc.   

Vivacious aims to be "serious 3rd party theme" With your support. And with it's new code-base is much easier to contribute to and dig into.

The GTK 3 portion of the theme has been completely re-written from scratch to look and work much better on a wide variety of desktops. While it bares resemblance to Ambiance & Radiance Flat Colors GTK Theme. The theme is based on a completely different codebase that should be cleaner, faster and easier to maintain for years to come. Ambiance code is getting a little dated and hard to maintain for non Unity Desktops.

The Vivacious GTK Theme has been re-written top to bottom to better support more desktops from the start! Including full support for GnomeShell & Cinnamon! (Vs. Ambiance & Radinace Flat Colors GTK Theme) But Vivacious Also Still Fully supports Unity, XFCE, MATE, LXDE, OpenBox and more as well!

:::::::::: Build: 16.04.4 : For GTK 3.18 + (LTS May 2016) :::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::: Some Things Just Go Together! :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


This theme is meant to go nicely with the Vivacious Icon Theme (By RAVEfinity.)

Grab that icon theme here:

:::::::::::::::::::::::: The Official Manual And Release Notes :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Version 16.04.4 (May 2016+) :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Supports Ubuntu 16.04+, Mint 18, Debian Rolling , Arch, OpenSuse, Fedora With GTK 3.18+ Only! 
Please Check your GTK version! Versions bellow & beyond 3.18 may not work as intended... It depends... We never know.
So always check for the latest build at www.ravefinity.com

The Vivacious GTK Theme has been re-written top to bottom to better support more desktops from the start! Including wayyy better support for GnomeShell & Cinnamon! (Better Vs. Ambiance & Radiance Flat Colors ) But Vivacious Also Still Fully supports Unity, XFCE, MATE, LXDE, OpenBox and more!

This is the 16.04.1 LTS version of the theme. for GTK 3.18+

It is RAVEfinity's hope to be able to support the latest and greatest GTK and Gnome versions with this theme as soon as possible. (A few weeks instead of mouths)
vs. Ambiance & Radiance Flat Colors that was harder to maintain and had dated Ubuntu/Unity specific code.

This theme is also written in a efficient way! One config file (GTK RC) for each of the 4 variations can literally be swapped between every color
meaning updates should be faster and not a complicated process! Also 3rd party contributions should be much easier! All you have to do is target one version.  

If you need support for older distros or GTK versions Please check out "Ambiance & Radiance Flat Colors" 
It is very similar to this theme but is based on
Ambiance & Radiance Code instead of Adwita code.
Please Download and use the 14.04 LTS version of that theme for "older" distros with GTK Versions 3.10- 3.12 
This NEW. theme is not backwards compatible with that old of GTK. Or 15.10/ 15.04 versions for Debian 8! See website! 

Designed and Developed by: The RAVEfinity "Open Source Design Team"

:::::::::::::::::::Previous Change log:::::::::::::::::::::

16.04.4 - Reverts GTK 3 Menu Border code. So other desktops do not draw double borders.
        - There is now a Vivacious-Unity Theme! It contains this border tweak enabled still as unity needs it. 

It also removes CSD borders as they make Compiz & Unity 7 Crash... When clicking minamize on CSD apps like corebird, calender etc.
WE DO NOT want to keep compromising the desktop look and feel and experince for other desktops just becuase Unity can not follow standards and no one cares to fix bugs on 7. Thus we made a tuff decision and made this change! if you run unity please Install the Vivacious-Unity-Light & Dark packages. If you run other desktops install or keep the regular Vivacious. 

16.04.3 - Fixes missing border around GTK Menus in Unity Desktop. Unity made changes to how they implement CSD.
        - Fixes Flat Edit-able buttons to show hover and pressed state (Unity Tweak, Gnome User Add. etc)
        - Makes border around popup menus contrast better (no more lost popups.)

16.04.2 - Adds back Pro Window Buttons! We realized they are missed and work better for users with displays with inaccurate color reproduction.
        - Adds Inactive (Window Open) state to desktop clicked items. 

16.04.1 - New for 2016! Ubuntu LTS Family, Mint 18 LTS and more! GTK 3.18 Support.

::::::::::::::::::::SETUP NOTES:::::::::::::::::::::


This theme was built to be a independent package that allows you to use the Vivacious Colors GTK Theme Colors Theme on any desktop, It does this by being a separate theme completely. It does not modify your stock Ambiance & Radiance Themes.

Thats being said just install and activate it on your desktop as shown bellow...
(If you installed this theme from our PPA or a package .Deb , RPM Arch etc you can safely skip to the setting up/ Activating New Theme section)

(!) Always back up your data and use these instructions at own risk! its not ours nor our contributors fault if anything goes wrong.
We have taken great strides to provide clear concise and safe instructions! But as always Do This at your own risk ! No Warranty!

Consider installing the Theme System Wide (See bellow) and it will work everywhere!
